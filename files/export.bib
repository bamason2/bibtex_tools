   abstract = {The teaching of engine mapping and calibration provides a unique challenge to Universities and Technical institutes the world over. The engine test cell facilities required for such tuition is prohibitively expensive for many organizations, for those fortunate enough to have the facilities their use is often already oversubscribed. In any case it is not desirable to have untrained operatives experimenting with expensive and potentially dangerous equipment without very close time intensive supervision. In the School of Engineering Design and Technology at the University of Bradford, although fortunate enough to have a number of state-of-the-art transient engine test cells, these safety concerns are contrasted against students' frustrations at a lack of practical experience in this area for the above reasons. Efforts have been made recently to increase students' exposure to the practical elements; this paper present two tools that are currently being developed to achieve this, a hardware-in-loop (HiL) engine test cell simulator and standalone software based calibration demonstrator. Feedback from students on the trial of the HiL rig and software tool has been very positive with the process having also assisted students in achieving a fuller understanding of the fundamentals of internal combustion engine operation. The rig and software tool has been shown to successfully provide an interactive learning experience that is conducted on the desktop rather than in an engine test cell ensuring (novice) operator safety and achieving considerable cost savings. Improvements to the rig in terms of its packaging and capabilities are currently being undertaken. © 2011 SAE International.},

   abstract = {The increasing complexity in the development and manufacturing process of internal combustion engines leads to a higher demand for more effective testing and monitoring methods. Cold engine testing becomes progressively the main End-of-Line test which is used nowadays from automotive engine manufacturers with the purpose of determining the integrity of engine assembly. The present work is focused on the development of a detailed physics-based, lumped-parameter, dynamic model of a single cylinder internal combustion engine coupled with an alternating current transient dynamometer for cold engine testing applications. The overall transient engine test cell model is described based on a two-inertia system model consisting of the engine, the dynamometer and the coupling shaft. The internal combustion engine is modelled based on First Law of Thermodynamics and Second Newton's Law for rotational bodies. The transient dynamometer is actually an alternating current three-phase induction motor which is modelled according to direct-quadrature axis approach, and its drive unit which is responsible for controlling the speed of the motor using indirect field orientation scheme. The engine and dynamometer are connected through a coupling shaft which is modelled as a compliant member with damping. The model is validated against experimental measurements such as engine cylinder pressure, engine excitation torque and alternating currents of the induction motor. All of the experimental measurements were recorded from an identical single cylinder transient engine test cell using a highly advanced instrumentation system. The described model serves as an ideal platform for developing innovative model-based fault detection and diagnosis techniques for cold engine testing applications. In conclusion, this is presented successfully for two simulated fault cases, a process fault and a sensor fault, proving the functionality and usefulness of the model.},

Speed information is extracted from the motor current spectrum by tracking the frequency of key components, which vary as a function of motor rotational speed. An important advantage of this technique is that the speed estimation algorithm is independent of motor mechanical and electrical parameters. The algorithm operates via estimating rotor bar number, which is in turn used to determine rotational speed via rotor bar pass frequency detection including a sanity check on estimated speed via comparison with a linear speed estimate based on rated nameplate data. Experimental results are included for a range of three-phase induction motors including motors carrying faults (bearing, rotor, stator and air-gap eccentricity). The results demonstrate the robustness of the algorithm to motors operating with a variety of faults and thus the potential for use of the algorithm in induction motor fault detection and diagnosis applications.</p>},

At the outset of this work, a review of literature summarises some of the current discussion concerning particulate formation, evolution and measurement to identify the key factors that influence these three things. Having established what these factors are a number of engine experiments are undertaken to determine how sensitive particulate number measurements are to change in these factors and therefore how great an influence they are on measurement repeatability in engine experiments of a similar type. The investigation highlights a number of important results, showing that particular regard ought to be given to the pre-conditioning of engine internal surfaces which begins when the engine is started. In addition, the effect of coolant temperature (including the dynamics of the control system) is observed and highlighted as another key source of variation as is intake air temperature.</p>},

   abstract = {The deactivation of one or more cylinders in internal combustion engines has long been established in literature as a means of reducing engine pumping losses and thereby improving brake specific fuel consumption. As down-sizing and down-speeding of modern engines becomes more extreme, drivability issues associated with mode transition become more acute and need to be managed within a suitable calibration framework. This paper presents methodology by which a calibration may be deduced for optimal mode-transitioning in respect of minimising the torque disturbance as cylinders are deactivated and re-activated. At the outset of this study a physics based engine model is used to investigate the key parameters that influence the transition. Having understood these, experiments are designed to establish the level of mode transition disturbance using quantitative statistical indicators such that the cost function may be defined and an optimisation undertaken. The efficacy of the proposed framework is illustrated using a state-of-art engine simulation model that replicates the functionality of a real variable displacement engine. Results show that during mode transition periods the peak torque deviation can be reduced up to five percent of the requested torque. The suggested methodology provides a solution to the mode transition disturbance of variable displacement engines, it is equally applicable in other hybrid/switching powertrain systems where mode transition disturbances are present such as homogeneous charge compression ignition engines and hybrid electric powertrains.},

   abstract = {The paper presents a measurement methodology which combines a fine-wire thermocouple with input reconstruction in order to measure crank angle resolved temperature in an engine air-intake system. Thermocouples that are of practical use in engine experiments tend to have a large time constant which affects measurement accuracy during rapid temperature transients. Input reconstruction methods have previously been applied to thermocouples but have not been specifically used in combination with an ultra-thin uninsulated wire thermocouple to investigate cyclic intake temperature behavior. Accurate measurement results are of interest to improve the validity of many crank-angle resolved engine models. An unshielded thermocouple sensor has been developed which is rigid enough to withstand the aerodynamic forces of the intake air. The nonlinear dependency of the sensor time constant was linearized and characterized at a number of mass flow rates by applying an identification method which uses two thermocouples with different diameters. For this purpose a test rig was designed to generate temperature step inputs at constant mass flow rates. A discrete time model of the sensor is finally directly inverted to reconstruct the true gas temperature. The results presented show how the sensor time constant was identified at several mass flow rates to establish a simple regression model describing the time constant as a function of air mass flow. Cyclic temperature data are finally presented including quick temperature transients caused by throttle tip-in and tip-out. The results are analyzed and compared with simulation results from a 1D engine model. This method simplifies previously demonstrated approaches and also applies, for the first time, the methodology for the purpose of intake-side cyclic temperature measurement.},

However, strong challenges lie in high efficient operations of the device due to its complexity.

Starting from a physical characterization of the engine, the controllability and the impact of the electrical turbocharger assist on fuel economy and exhaust emissions are both analyzed. A multivariable robust controller is designed to regulate the dynamics of the electrified turbocharged engine in a systematic approach. To minimize the fuel consumption in real time, a supervisory level controller is designed to update the setpoints of key controlled variables in an optimal way.

   abstract = {Thermoelectric generator has very quickly become a hot research topic in the last five years because its broad application area and very attractive features such as no moving parts, low maintenance, variety of thermoelectric materials that total together cover a wide temperature range. The biggest disadvantage of the thermoelectric generator is its low conversion efficiency. So that when design and manufacture a thermoelectric generator for exhaust waste heat recovery from an automotive engine, the benefit of fuel consumption from applying a thermoelectric generator would be very sensitive to the weight, the dimensions, the cost and the practical conversion efficiency. Additionally, the exhaust gas conditions vary with the change of engine operating point. This creates a big challenge for the design of the hot side heat exchanger in terms of optimizing the electrical output of the thermoelectric generator during an engine transient cycle. Based on experimental work and a validated thermoelectric generator dynamic model, the authors have identified a few issues that have big impact on the thermoelectric generator performance for automotive applications. Potential solutions also have been proposed and discussed in this paper. They include module level optimization, heat exchanger design optimization in terms of fin thermal resistance for a transient cycle, assembly and interface optimization aims for compact size and minimized contact thermal resistance, optimization of the number of modules for total maximum power output etc.},

In this study, the performance of MVEM is evaluated by comparing air-path dynamics during transient and steady-state operation for a turbocharged gasoline engine. The comparison is performed experimentally by the measurement of port and manifold fast pressures and calculated air mass flow during speed and torque transient tests. In addition, engine models can be linearised to facilitate rapid estimation. In this regard, a nonlinear intake manifold model is linearised and several linear parameter varying (LPV) models are formulated. Investigation of MVEM shows the transient cycles are within the steady-state range, whilst the effects of turbocharger performance are significant. The LPV modelling approach showed approximately 90% conformity between the linear and nonlinear models for estimating manifold pressure.},

Electric turbochargers can solve the dilemma between engine downsizing and vehicle driveability. Using the electric turbocharger, the transient response at low engine speeds can be recovered by air boosting assistance. Meanwhile, the introduction of electric machine makes the engine control more complicated. One emerging issue is to harness the augmented engine air system in a systematical way. Therefore, the boosting requirement can be achieved fast without violating exhaust emission standards. Another raised issue is to design an real time energy management strategy. This is of critical to minimise the required battery capacity. Moreover, using the on-board battery in a high efficient way is essential to avoid over-frequent switching of the electric machine. This requests the electric machine to work as a generator to recharge the battery. The capability of generating power strongly depends on the engine operating point. One big challenge is that the calibration of generating power capability is time-consuming in experiments. This paper proposes a neuro-fuzzy approach to model the engine. Based on the virtual engine model, the capability of generating power at arbitrary engine operating point can be obtained fast and accurately, which is applicable to implement in real time.},

   abstract = {The process of engine mapping in the automotive industry identifies steady-state engine responses by running an engine at a given operating point (speed and load) until its output has settled. While the time simulating this process with a computational model for one set of parameters is relatively short, the cumulative time to map all possible combinations becomes computationally inefficient. This work presents an alternative method for mapping out the steady-state response of an engine in simulation by applying bifurcation theory. The bifurcation approach used in this work allows the engine's steady-state response to be traced through the model's state-parameter space under the simultaneous variation of one or more model parameters. To demonstrate this approach, a bifurcation analysis of a simplified nonlinear engine model is presented. Using "throttle position" and "desired load torque signal", the engine's dynamic response is classified into distinct regions bounded by bifurcation points. These bifurcations are shown to correspond to key physical properties of the open-loop system: fold bifurcations correspond to the minimum throttle angle required for a steady-state engine response; Hopf bifurcations bound a region where self-sustaining oscillations occur. The techniques used in this case study demonstrate the efficiency a bifurcation approach has at highlighting different regions of dynamic behavior in the engine's state-parameter space. Such an approach could speed up the mapping process and enhance the automotive engineer's understanding of an engine's underlying dynamic behavior. The information obtained from the bifurcation analysis could also be used to inform the design of future engine control strategies.},

   abstract = {This paper presents a novel approach to augment existing engine calibrations to deliver improved engine performance during a transient, through the application of multi-objective optimization techniques to the calibration of the Variable Valve Timing (VVT) system of a 1.0 litre gasoline engine. Current mature calibration approaches for the VVT system are predominantly based on steady state techniques which fail to consider the engine dynamic behaviour in real world driving, which is heavily transient. In this study the total integrated fuel consumption and engine-out NOx emissions over a 2-minute segment of the transient Worldwide Light-duty Test Cycle are minimised in a constrained multi-objective optimisation framework to achieve an updated calibration for the VVT control. The cycle segment was identified as an area with high NOx emissions. The optimisation framework was developed around a Mean Value Engine Model (MVEM) with representative engine controls which was validated against an engine tested on a dynamometer. The aim of this study was to demonstrate a practical benefit without having to significantly change the existing engine control strategy. Offline optimization with the MVEM model allows exploitation of workstation computational performance to effectively explore the calibration space, reducing both time and investment in engine testing. The initial simulation optimization results show a strong dominance of both fuel and NOx objectives with a potential reduction in fuel consumption and engine out NOX emissions of up to 5% and 18% respectively compared to the original steady-state based VVT calibration. Engine experimental results have confirmed that NOX emissions can be significantly reduced without any significant detriment to fuel economy over this 2min transient.},

   abstract = {Traditional approaches to engine torque mapping apply steady or quasi-steady-state approaches for data collection. Engine actuators are moved to some set-point and the engine is left to stabilise. Data is then recorded at fixed actuator settings over a period of time and averaged, the size of the averaging 'window' is often arbitrarily chosen. Such methods are time intensive and inefficient with the majority of the time available for data collection wasted. In this paper, a novel and fully transient characterisation methodology is introduced. Dynamic excitation signals are used in this work to significantly increase the rate of data collection and settling time (after an initial warm-up) is no longer required. Engine dynamic behaviour is described using first-order conditionally linear repeated measurement models, these reflect the inherent structure of the torque data that is a consequence of the experimental method employed. Model parameters are determined using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE). To abstract steady-state data from the dynamic models (a requirement of legacy controllers) the models are extrapolated, in time, for fixed input settings. The efficacy of the extrapolation procedure is clearly demonstrated through direct comparison with actual steady-state sweeps utilised for validation of the method. The approach is shown to be seven times faster than conventional methods based on slow ramps or steady-state test.},

Hybrid vehicles are suitable alternatives to traditional vehicles. Travelling information is essential for hybrid vehicles to design the optimal control strategy for fuel consumption minimization and emissions reduction. In general, there are two ways to provide the information for the energy management strategy (EMS) design. First is extracting terrain information by utilizing global positioning system (GPS) and intelligent transportation system (ITS). However, this method is difficult to be implemented currently due to the computational complexity of extracting information. This leads to the second method which is predicting future vehicle speed and torque demand in a certain time horizon based on current and previous vehicle states.

However, they are typically long and costly to test, with questions of repeatability and real-world relevance.

This paper presents a methodology for identifying key behaviours (or information rich regions) from the current worldwide harmonised light-duty test cycle (WLTC) type approval test using a moving 2-minute window approach. Three techniques for pattern recognition are presented and applied to data collected from a modern Gasoline Turbocharged Direct Injection (GTDI) engine, run through the WLTC. The techniques examine different points in the process, with the first examining response data, and working backwards to the original vehicle speed cycle specification. The first two techniques, Intensity Ratio (IR) for cumulative responses and Energy Residency (ER) for engine inputs, are newly developed in this paper. The final technique, Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) is a new application of an existing tool to the subject of vehicle drive cycles. The techniques are examined in isolation and discussed, before being brought together to identify commonly agreed information rich sub-cycle candidates that best represent the parent cycle. The techniques make use of a combination of time windowing, signal derivative and peak analysis methods. The two-minute window is chosen based on the length of an existing sub-cycle that was identified as part of earlier work, and this method is also described and validated in this paper. One sub-cycle identified by the approach represents a duration reduction of 93% to a containable 2-minute transient. This segment accounts for 15% of the overall WLTC fuel used. A discussion of the techniques and their applications is presented to motivate future work in this area.},

The methodology presented and capability of the instrumentation enables fine resolution of emissions events leading to the opportunity for fine tuning of controller performance. Data has also been logged from the vehicles' ECUs and combined with accurate GPS data. The results show that certain road lay-outs (e.g., congested junctions and speed bumps) can provoke significant tailpipe NOx emissions; often emitting very high levels near schools where traffic calming measures have been adopted for road safety.

   abstract = {<p>Creep groan is the undesirable vibration observed in the brake pad and disc as brakes are applied during low-speed driving. The presence of friction leads to nonlinear behavior even in simple models of this phenomenon. This paper uses tools from bifurcation theory to investigate creep groan behavior in a nonlinear 3-degrees-of-freedom mathematical model. Three areas of operational interest are identified, replicating results from previous studies: region 1 contains repelling equilibria and attracting periodic orbits (creep groan); region 2 contains both attracting equilibria and periodic orbits (creep groan and no creep groan, depending on initial conditions); region 3 contains attracting equilibria (no creep groan). The influence of several friction model parameters on these regions is presented, which identify that the transition between static and dynamic friction regimes has a large influence on the existence of creep groan. Additional investigations discover the presence of several bifurcations previously unknown to exist in this model, including Hopf, torus and period-doubling bifurcations. This insight provides valuable novel information about the nature of creep groan and indicates that complex behavior can be discovered and explored in relatively simple models.</p>},

This review article seeks to provide readers with an overview of prominent BMS subsystems and their influence on vehicle performance, along with their architectures. Moreover, it collates many recent research activities and critically reviews various control strategies and execution topologies implied in different aspects of BMSs, including battery modeling, states estimation, cell-balancing, and thermal management. The internal architecture of a BMS, along with the architectures of the control modules, is examined to demonstrate the working of an entire BMS control module. Moreover, a critical review of different battery models, control approaches for state estimation, cell-balancing, and thermal management is presented in terms of their salient features and merits and demerits allowing readers to analyze and understand them. The review also throws light on modern technologies implied in BMS, such as IoT (Internet of Things) and cloud-based BMS, to address issues of battery safety. Towards the end of the review, some challenges associated with the design and development of efficient BMSs for E-mobility applications are discussed and the article concludes with recommendations to tackle these challenges.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>Road vehicles are a large contributor to nitrogen oxides (NOx) pollution. The routine roadside monitoring stations, however, may underrepresent the severity of personal exposure in urban areas because long-term average readings cannot capture the effects of momentary, high peaks of air pollution. While numerical modelling tools historically have been used to propose an improved distribution of monitoring stations, ultra-high resolution Computational Fluid Dynamics models can further assist the relevant stakeholders in understanding the important details of pollutant dispersion and exposure at a local level. This study deploys a 10-cm-resolution CFD model to evaluate actual high peaks of personal exposure to NOx from traffic by tracking the gases emitted from the tailpipe of moving vehicles being dispersed towards the roadside. The investigation shows that a set of four Euro 5-rated diesel vehicles travelling at a constant speed may generate momentary roadside concentrations of NOx as high as 1.25 mg/m3, with a 25% expected increase for doubling the number of vehicles and approximately 50% reduction when considering Euro 6-rated vehicles. The paper demonstrates how the numerical tool can be used to identify the impact of measures to reduce personal exposure, such as protective urban furniture, as traffic patterns and environmental conditions change.</p>},

A Ricardo WAVE model of a representative GTDI engine was adapted to include a TG (Turbogenerator) and TBV (Turbine Bypass Valve) with the TG in a mechanical turbocompounding configuration, calibrated using steady state mapping data. This was integrated into a co-simulation environment with a SISO (Single-Input, Single-Output) dynamic controller developed in SIMULINK for the actuator control (with BMEP, manifold air pressure and TG pressure ratio as the controlled variables). Transient verification with WAVE-RT was conducted on WLTP and NEDC drive cycles, estimating dynamic energy recovery and fuel consumption improvement.

Key to achieving optimum performance for a given hardware set and control scheme is a calibration that optimizes controller gains such that inputs are scheduled over the operating space to minimize emissions and maximize fuel economy. Generating a suitable calibration requires data that is both precise and accurate, this data is used to generate models that are deployed as part of the calibration optimization process. This paper evaluates the repeatability of typical steady-state measurements used for calibration of engine controllers that will ultimately determine vehicle level emissions for homologation include Real Driving Emissions (RDE). Stabilization requirements as indicated by three different measurements are evaluated and shown to be different within the same experiment, depending on the metric used. It is shown that this results in emissions and fuel economy measurements that differ, again for the same experiment, in both their mean value and variance. Differences between the measurement results are shown to be a consequence of the dynamics of the system and that the errors introduced by steady-state measurement are likely to be propagated through to the Response Surface Models used within the calibration optimization process. This discrepancy contributes to the differences between real-world and reported values for emissions and fuel economy.},

For a complex system with high dimensional nonlinear behaviour, excitation signal design is non-trivial. This paper presents a novel methodology for excitation signal design to create high accuracy multivariable nonlinear dynamic neuro-fuzzy models. Two different approaches to experimental design are investigated. In the first, a prescribed transient manoeuvre is used. In the second, informative potential is used to deconstruct the transient into a sequence of inputs designed to cover the same input space and reduce model development time. Star discrepancy is used to evaluate the resulting designs and is shown to provide a good proxy for excitation design quality. Results are presented showing the prediction accuracy of the model in terms of an application example, achieving a minimum <2% cumulative error over a two minute transient. It is shown that the neuro-fuzzy models identified using data from the two different approaches have similar accuracy. However, the second approach based on informative potential leads to a more generalised model and reduces the development time by a factor of four. This is a significant result that shows the importance of choosing an appropriate excitation signal.},

   abstract = {Significant exhaust enthalpy is wasted in gasoline turbocharged direct injection (GTDI) engines; even at moderate loads the WG (Wastegate) starts to open. This action is required to reduce EBP (Exhaust Back Pressure). Another factor is catalyst protection, placed downstream turbine. Lambda enrichment is used to perform this. However, the conventional turbine has a temperature drop across it when used for energy recovery. Catalyst performance is critical for emissions, therefore the only location for any additional device is downstream of it. This is a challenge for any additional energy recovery, but a smaller turbine is a design requirement, optimised to work at lower operating pressure ratios. A WAVE model of the 2.0L GTDI engine was adapted to include a TG (Turbogenerator) and TBV (Turbine Bypass Valve) with the TG in a mechanical turbocompounding configuration, calibrated with steady state dynamometer data to estimate drive cycle benefit. The model derived is used in the development of more advanced control system algorithms. Furthermore, transient verification with WAVE-RT in co-simulation is performed on drive cycles (NEDC, WLTP). Analysis includes power and fuel consumption, and an additional knock impact assessment. It is shown on the WLTP that, depending on the calibration, up to 9\% FC (Fuel Consumption) reduction is achievable with a 0.03kW thermodynamic power recovery, for a similar controller performance. Hints are given for further controller enhancements. Prototype dynamometer testing or vehicle could be performed to verify design assumptions and simulation results. Electrical turbo-compounding, interfacing to the power-grid, and calibration optimisation, with combined WG and TBV settings is feasible based on this initial work.},

A 6DOF mathematical model of this phenomenon is used to identify how the key parameters of driveline stiffness, axle mass and fore/aft stiffness change the system’s dynamics. A bifurcation analysis is performed to study this nonlinear system’s dynamics. Four Hopf bifurcations in the underlying equilibria, along with a fold bifurcation in the outermost limit cycle branch, are shown to bound the parameter space where tramp occurs. The severity of tramp was found to be minimised by increasing drivetrain stiffness, reducing axle mass or increasing fore/aft stiffness: the trade-off for minimising tramp severity is that it may be easier to excite tramp when the drivetrain stiffness is increased, and the speed range over which tramp can occur is increased as fore/aft stiffness is increased. A key outcome from this work is that future electrified powertrains may experience more tramp, albeit at a reduced magnitude, than their combustion-powered counterparts.</p>},

In the context of real-time testing, numerical modelling and simulation of electric vehicle (EV) powertrains play a vital role in developing an efficient electric powertrain and charging infrastructure as it consumes less time and cost. Also, it enhances the overall performance by optimizing the size and configuration of the EV powertrain under different driving conditions. Thus, the review paper explores the different modelling approaches used for estimating the energy consumption (EC) and driving range (DR) initially. Further, the vehicle analytical model is discussed in detail with sub-models of powertrain components and vehicle dynamics, which have the mathematical correlation related to power losses and energy flow. Additionally, the necessity, development process, characterization and accuracy of localized driving cycles (DCs) and commonly used driver controller models for EVs are critically elaborated. Further, the impact of various influential input parameters such as vehicle parameters and driving conditions on EV performance characteristics is analyzed along with different improvisation methods utilized in the existing literature. From this extensive review, it can be concluded that simulation results by using an analytical vehicle model have good accuracy with chassis dynamometer-based testing and it can be used for optimizing the size and configuration of EV powertrain components under different scenarios. Finally, the present status and future research required in the field of EV powertrain development through modelling and simulation are summarized to extend the application of EVs in transportation sectors.},

Antithetically, controlling SRM is challenging due to its nonlinearities and variable parameters such as speed, torque, flux, etc. In this study, a novel approach is used to control the speed and torque of SRM with various controllers. This methodology integrates model-in-loop (MIL) and hardware-in-loop (HIL) simulations to evaluate the efficiency of SRM in electric vehicles (Evs). To reduce the speed variations in the SRM, PID, intelligent, hybrid, and adaptive supervisory self-learning control approaches (ASSC) are used. The mathematical models of the aforementioned controllers were created in MATLAB/Simulink, and these control approaches are used to reduce speed, torque, and current fluctuations under various load and speed conditions. In this paper, both simulation and experimental work are used to investigate the various dynamic characteristics of the SRM in Evs. From the simulation findings, the proposed ASSC controller exhibits less overshoot (1.05%), settling time (0.02s) and risetime (0.01s) than PID, intelligent and hybrid control approaches. The proposed ASSC method combines numerical data and real-time rules knowledge with ANN to predict error responses in the SR motor. Also, it is significantly reducing the speed, torque, current and flux ripples of the SRM from low to high speed with different load conditions. Further, to verify the simulation results experimental work is conducted and similar results are measured under different load and speed conditions. From experimentation, efficiency maps are developed for PID, intelligent, hybrid, and ASSCs across the entire operating range. The maps show that the controller's maximum efficiency is, respectively, 85%, 88%, 91%, and 95%. The supervisory controller is 10% more efficient than PID, intelligent, and hybrid controllers in terms of various dynamic characteristics of SRM. From the observations, both experimental and simulation results corroborated that the recommended ASSC improves the SRM efficiency.},

   abstract = {This paper proposes a less-disturbed ecological driving strategy for connected and automated vehicles (CAVs). The proposed strategy integrates the offline planning and the online tracking. In offline planning, an energy efficient reference speed is created based on traffic information (such as the average traffic speed) and characteristics of the vehicle (such as the engine efficiency map) via dynamic programming. The consideration of average traffic speed in speed planning avoids selfish optimisations. In online tracking, model predictive control is employed to update the vehicle speed in real-time to track the reference speed. A key challenge in applying ecological driving strategies in real driving is that the vehicle has to consider other traffic participants when tracking the reference speed. Therefore, this paper combines both longitudinal control and lateral control to achieve better speed tracking by overtaking the preceding vehicle when necessary. The proposed less-disturbed ecological driving strategy has been evaluated in simulations in both single road segment scenario and real traffic environment. Comparisons of the proposed method with benchmark strategies and human drivers are made. The results demonstrate that the proposed less-disturbed ecological driving strategy is more effective in energy saving. Compared to human drivers, the less-disturbed eco-driving strategy improves the fuel efficiency of CAVs by 4.53%.},

   abstract = {<p>Model identification of nonlinear time varying dynamic systems is challenging because the system behaviours may vary significantly in different operational conditions. If the changes are insufficiently captured by training data, the trained model is unable to capture the system response well when the operational condition changes. The model performance may also be deteriorated in real-time implementation due to the noise in sensors or the environment. This paper presents a self-adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy (NF) modelling framework to address these challenges. The NF model, trained offline based on experimental data, combines the Auto-Regressive with eXogenous (ARX) models and Gaussian activation functions to capture the nonlinear system behaviours. During online implementation, the ARX model parameters are updated using new data through a recursive generalised least squares method, which embeds a noise model to eliminate effects of the noise. The online updating algorithm has a provable convergence guarantee and enables the proposed NF model to adapt to changes in system behaviours automatically. Efficacy of the algorithm is verified through two numerical examples and an experiment on a commercial automotive engine.</p>},

   abstract = {Transient test cycles are an essential part of the development of both on and off-highway vehicles and machines. These cycles are used to test and validate the dynamic operation and performance of systems, and they also form part of regulations such as Real-world Driving Emissions (RDE). A common approach to generating a transient cycle is to replicate recorded real-world transient operation. However, the dynamics of transient operation can vary significantly based on factors such as the operating environment, the use case, the user, and the type of vehicle or machine. The feasible duration of a transient test cycle is also often limited by development time and cost. Therefore, there is a need for a method to synthesize transient test cycles from real-world data in order to replicate a wide range of feasible dynamic operation in the shortest possible time. This paper proposes an innovative transient Cycle Decomposition and Reduction (CDR) method that generates a shortened representative driving cycle in speed-torque two-dimensional space. The steps include identifying micro-trajectories using critical points (e.g. minimum torque), identifying features of micro-trajectories, grouping similar micro-trajectories using k-means clustering and Gaussian process models, and using Markov chain models to efficiently splice together the micro-transients to form a new reduced cycle. The method is flexible and can be used to generate reduced transient cycles for both on-road and off-road applications. The proposed CDR method is demonstrated by using it to perturb a system and collect data for the identification of nonlinear dynamic system models. A 30-minute transient cycle is reduced to a 200-second representative cycle, which is used to train a Neuro-Fuzzy NOx emission model. The results show that this model can accurately predict NOx emissions behaviour over the original transient cycle. The proposed CDR method is easy to expand to higher dimensions and can be applied in a wide range of applications. Additionally, the information extracted during the process has useful physical meaning and can be further utilised, for example in driving pattern recognition, vehicle diagnosis, and autonomous vehicles.},

   abstract = {<p>Piston surface temperature is an important factor in reducing harmful emissions in modern Gasoline Direct Injection engines. In transient operation, the piston surface temperature can change rapidly, increasing the risk of fuel puddling. The prediction of the piston surface temperature provides the means to significantly improve multiple-pulse fuel injection strategies by avoiding fuel puddling. It can also be used to intelligently control the Piston Cooling Jet (PCJ) which are common on modern engines. Considerable research has been undertaken to identify generalized engine heat transfer correlations and to predict piston and cylinder wall surface temperatures during operation. Most of these correlations require in-cylinder combustion pressure as an input, as well as the identification of numerous model parameters, these render such an approach impractical. In this study, the authors have developed a thermodynamic model of piston surface temperature based on the Global Energy Balance (GEB) methodology, which includes the effect of PCJ activation. The advantages are the simple structure, no requirement for in-cylinder pressure data, and only limited experimental tests are needed for model parameter identification. Moreover, the proposed model works well during engine transient operation, with maximum average error of 6.68% during rapid transients. A detailed identification procedure is given. This, and the model performance, have been demonstrated using experimental piston crown surface temperature data from a prototype 1-liter 3-cylinder turbocharged GDI engine, operated in both engine steady-state and transient conditions with an oil jet used for piston cooling turned both on and off.</p>},
